# Pima-indians
Hello world, what's up? Today I am coming with another repository about deep learning. This repository aims to help you understand how to build a basic deep learning model by performing a simple classification task on the pima indians dataset.

## Introduction
The Pima indians are a group of Native Americans well known for the high rate of obesity and diabetes present in the community. For this particular reason, many researchers study that group in order to understand which factors play a major role in causing the diseases. In this  post, we'll try to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements. To achieve our goal, we'll use the Pima Indians Diabetes Database provided by UCI.

Here's a picture of some pima people.
